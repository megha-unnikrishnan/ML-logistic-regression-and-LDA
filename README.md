# ML-logistic-regression-and-LDA
While both methods are used for classification, the ultimate difference between the two is that logistic regression is for determining categorical variables,
while linear discriminant analysis is for modeling continuous variables.

Both classification problems are performed using a movie dataset.

## BASIC STEPS TO FOLLOW :

## TOOLS DESCRIPTION
### Pandas
- pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
### Numpy
- Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays
### Seaborn 
- Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.





## STEPS TO TRAIN LOGISTIC REGRESSION

- Create a classification object for Logistic regression

- Fit the trained data

- Build the model using Logit function

- Predict the values

- Find the accuracy of the models using Confusion Matrix


## STEPS TO TRAIN LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS

- Train the models with independent and dependent variables

- Create a classification object for linear disciminant analysis

- Fit the trained data


- Build the model using Logit function
- Predict the values

- Find the accuracy of the models using Confusion Matrix
