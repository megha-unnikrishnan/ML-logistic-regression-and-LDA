# ML-logistic-regression-and-LDA
While both methods are used for classification, the ultimate difference between the two is that logistic regression is for determining categorical variables,
while linear discriminant analysis is for modeling continuous variables.

Both classification problems are performed using a movie dataset.

BASIC STEPS TO FOLLOW TO TRAIN A MODEL

*)Load the dataset

*)Fill the missing values in the dataset

*)converts series of strings to dummy codes



#STEPS TO TRAIN LOGISTIC REGRESSION

1)Train the models with independent and dependent variables

2)Create a classification object for Logistic regression

3)Fit the trained data

4)Build the model using Logit function

5)Predict the values

6)Find the accuracy of the models using Confusion Matrix


#STEPS TO TRAIN LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS

1)Train the models with independent and dependent variables

2)Create a classification object for linear disciminant analysis

3)Fit the trained data


4)Build the model using Logit function
5)Predict the values

6)Find the accuracy of the models using Confusion Matrix
